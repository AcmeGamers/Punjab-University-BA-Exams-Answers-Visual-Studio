# Introduction
Dedicated to the people who can't find answers to the programs and were in private admission for the Visual Studio Answers or workings on how to make the code.

## Notice
I will create comments and better work of it once I get free and will make a few short sessions (probably 2-3 mins ones) to help others understand the code and logics
